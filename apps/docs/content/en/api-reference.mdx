# API Reference

## Authentication

After obtaining an access token (see [How to Get an Access Token](./get-token)), you can use it to authenticate requests to Workstream's public API using Bearer token authentication.

### Bearer Token Authentication

Include the access token in the `Authorization` header of your API requests:

```
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

### Example Request

```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/protected-resource', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
});
```

## Notes

- Access tokens are JWT tokens that expire after a certain period (typically 3600 seconds / 1 hour)
- Always use HTTPS when making API requests
- Store tokens securely and refresh them before expiration
- Handle 401 Unauthorized responses by obtaining a new token
