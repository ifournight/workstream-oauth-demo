# How to Create an OAuth Client

This guide will walk you through creating an OAuth client using the demo application.

## Prerequisites

- Access to the demo application
- A valid user account (authentication required)

## Steps to Create an OAuth Client

### Step 1: Access the Demo Application

Navigate to the demo application URL: <EnvVar name="DEMO_URL" />

### Step 2: Log In

If you're not already logged in, you'll be redirected to the login page. Complete the authentication process to obtain your identity ID.

### Step 3: Navigate to "My OAuth Clients"

Once logged in, navigate to the **"My OAuth Clients"** page from the sidebar navigation.

### Step 4: Create a New Client

1. Click the **"+ Create Client"** button
2. You'll be taken to the create client page
3. Fill in the **Client Name** field (e.g., "My OAuth App")
4. The **Owner Identity ID** field will be automatically populated with your identity ID
5. Click **"Create Client"** to submit

### Step 5: Save Your Credentials

After successful creation, you'll be redirected to a success page that displays:

- **Client ID** (`client_id`)
- **Client Secret** (`client_secret`)
- Other client configuration details

**⚠️ Important**: The client secret is only shown once. Make sure to copy and securely store both the `client_id` and `client_secret` immediately.

## Next Steps

Once you have your client credentials, you can:

- [Get an Access Token](./get-token) using your `client_id` and `client_secret`
- Use the access token to make authenticated API calls

## Notes

- Each client is tied to your identity (user account)
- You can create multiple clients for different applications
- The client secret cannot be retrieved later if lost - store it securely
