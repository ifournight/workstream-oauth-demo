# Getting Started

This guide will help you get started with the OAuth Demo Application.

## Prerequisites

- Access to the demo application
- A valid user account (must be migrated to Workstream Identity v2)

Identity v2 is not fully ready yet. As a temporary workaround:

- Register a dedicated users account for development and grant the proper permissions in hr.workstream.us
- Share the account email with a Workstream engineer so it can be upgraded to Identity v2
- After the upgrade, the user must log in to hr.workstream.us again to complete the account registration flow
- This account can be used for oauth apps development

## Overview

The OAuth Demo Application allows you to:

1. **Create OAuth Clients** - Generate client ID and secret for your applications
2. **Obtain Access Tokens** - Exchange client credentials for access tokens
3. **Use the API** - Make authenticated API calls with your access tokens

## Next Steps

- [Create an OAuth Client](./create-client)
- [Get an Access Token](./get-token)
